Harris on April 13,1959. Quail Hollow is located at 3700 Glen Eagles Road in Charlotte, N.C. The club has hosted previous PGA TOUR events.<\/P>\n","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/20180501152949184508502SVRNAYCQV6.jpg","holes": [{"number":"1","parValue":"4","yards":"495","body":"Lengthened during the most recent course additions in 2016, the first hole is now in essence a combination of the former first and second holes. A long, left to right tee shot will place players atop an elevated landing zone and beyond the edge of the dogleg. From here, players will face a mid to long iron for their second to a small and undulating green protected by three large bunkers.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011535395144737SVRNAYCQYS.jpg"},{"number":"2","parValue":"4","yards":"452","body":"As a result of the recent additions to the first hole, this long par-4 will now play as the second hole. Players will need a 280-yard drive to reach the turn in the fairway, then another 170-yard, mid-iron shot to the green. The elevated green has a back-to-front slope; miss it and par will be tough to make.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011537491064125SVRNAYCR26.jpg"},{"number":"3","parValue":"4","yards":"483","body":"The third hole is a troublesome par-4 that requires a long, accurate tee shot. The tee was moved 50 yards to the left in 2012 to make the hole play more straight away and to create a better angle for the tee shot. The elevated third green is surrounded by three bunkers and is also divided by a small ridge separating the front from the back.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011538593683439SVRNAYCR2V.jpg"},{"number":"4","parValue":"3","yards":"167","body":"Carved out of land that was once the former par-5 fifth hole, the new par-3 fourth will present an entirely new challenge for players. Framed beautifully by a group of tall pines, the fourth features a large undulating green fronted by three bunkers. Although the trees will not come into play, shots that fly long will end up below the green surface resulting in a difficult up and down.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/20180501154013632288102SVRNAYCR3N.jpg"},{"number":"5","parValue":"4","yards":"449","body":"The fifth will be another new challenge for players. A result of 2016 additions, it plays down, and back up a shallow valley to a green that sits on a hillside behind the sixth tee. This slight dogleg right requires a well-placed tee shot to find a fairway protected by bunkers on either side. On their approach, players will face a narrow green that is well-guarded by a front right bunker.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/20180501154233234772202SVRNAYCR54.jpg"},{"number":"6","parValue":"3","yards":"249","body":"This is the longest par-3 on the course and plays downhill. A hybrid or long iron is the likely club of choice for the tee shot. The green, which slopes from back to front, follows Quail Hollow's propensity for devilish contours and gives players an opportunity to showcase their ability to conquer demanding short shots and putts.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011544414453668SVRNAYCR6F.jpg"},{"number":"7","parValue":"5","yards":"546","body":"This is the shortest par 5 on the course and most of the players will reach the green in two, making eagle opportunities a real possibility. It is a tight driving hole and tee shots must navigate bunkers on the left, plus a creek that runs down the entire right side. The sloped green is tucked behind water and surrounded by bunkers, making this hole a harder endeavor than it first appears.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011546214761984SVRNAYCR7H.jpg"},{"number":"8","parValue":"4","yards":"346","body":"Players may try to drive the green or lay up and play a wedge from the sloped fairway. A new tee and green were built in 2012 that made it more enticing for players to use a driver. In 2013, the hole was modified with over 10 feet of elevation and two bunkers added to the left-side of the fairway. The green complex was completely rebuilt, giving it softer contours and an expanded landing area.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011547486083666SVRNAYCR8D.jpg"},{"number":"9","parValue":"4","yards":"505","body":"This is not only one of the longest par-4's at Quail Hollow, but may also be the toughest. The bunker on the right is very much in play and uphill second shots require a long iron or fairway wood. The medium-sized green has plenty of movement and many hole placement options. Guarding the green are two front bunkers, the right having been added during the most recent course additions.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011548557120367SVRNAYCR94.jpg"},{"number":"10","parValue":"5","yards":"592","body":"This is the longest and most arduous of the par 5s. For an eagle opportunity, players must overcome a bunker on the left with a 300-yard drive and then tackle a formidable second shot. The back-to-front and right-to-left sloping green will also call for a great deal of skill; if a player should miscalculate, they will be left with some tricky putts.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011550256493131SVRNAYCRA2.jpg"},{"number":"11","parValue":"4","yards":"462","body":"Lengthened by nearly 40 yards during the most recent course additions, the eleventh now presents a formidable challenge. A large oak that previously sat left of the fairway at the dogleg has been replaced by two large bunkers, which will catch those attempting to cut the corner. The new green now sits elevated, and is guarded by deep bunkers on the left.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/20180501155346561376SVRNAYCRC5.jpg"},{"number":"12","parValue":"4","yards":"456","body":"This beautiful but dangerous hole requires a left-to-right tee shot. The fairway is perilously narrow with trees tightly guarding both sides. The severely sloping green further complicates things, placing even more emphasis on the need for a long, accurate drive so the approach shot will be shorter and easier to keep below the cup. Bogies are very likely to happen here.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011555561916068SVRNAYCRDG.jpg"},{"number":"13","parValue":"3","yards":"208","body":"A 200-yard mid-iron shot is needed to reach an exacting green that lies between two large bunkers. The two-level green has a sizable collection area on the right middle portion as well as a wicked back-to-front slope. This one is an easy par, but a difficult birdie. In 2013, the green was moved approximately 15 yards to the left of the former location and the contours were completely.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011557426399744SVRNAYCREK.jpg"},{"number":"14","parValue":"4","yards":"344","body":"Hazards abound on this harsh, hilly par-4. Players must shoot at a long, narrow green while avoiding six bunkers and water down the left side. There are multiple options - from driving the green to laying back with a long iron - but whatever players choose, this is sure to be a make-or-break hole. Head for the hill by the landing zone for great views of the difficult tee and approach shots.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011559163750997SVRNAYCRFK.jpg"},{"number":"15","parValue":"5","yards":"577","body":"The last of the par 5s plays uphill after the tee shot. The water on the left and right of the fairway may appear dangerous; however, it will probably have little effect on the professionals. A ridge running down the middle of the green requires perhaps more caution and an accurate approach.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/20180501160115764880302SVRNAYCRGS.jpg"},{"number":"16","parValue":"4","yards":"506","body":"This is the beginning of the \"Green Mile\" -- one of the toughest finishing stretches in professional golf. The hole was modified in 2013 and the green was moved 80 yards to the left and now sits on the edge of the lake. What was once a straight away par-4 is now a dogleg right that demands an accurate tee shot that will leave a demanding mid-iron shot into a green guarded on the left by water.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011602419900366SVRNAYCRHP.jpg"},{"number":"17","parValue":"3","yards":"223","body":"The green on Quail Hollow's Signature Hole is nearly an island, forcing a carry of nearly 195 yards but can play much shorter if one of the forward teeing grounds are used. With the variety of hole locations available on this green it can be hole where bogies or worse can outnumber the number of birdies. In 2013 the tees on this hole were relocated to the site of the old 16th green.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011604162208992SVRNAYCRJP.jpg"},{"number":"18","parValue":"4","yards":"494","body":"This is the last of the \"The Green Mile\" and is consistently one of the toughest finishing holes in golf. Players must avoid a bunker on the right, as well as a creek that meanders along the entire left side of the narrow fairway. An uphill second shot must avoid hazards on both sides of the green, which is deep and sloped.","image":"\/tournaments\/r480\/images\/201805011606122727722SVRNAYCRKV.jpg"}]}]}
