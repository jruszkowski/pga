{"header": { "version" : "1.0"},"pageType":"course","tourCode":"r","permNum":"027","pageTitle":"Course","courses": [{"number":"762","sortOrder":"1","name":"Liberty National GC","parValue":"72","yards":"7387","body":"","image":"","holes": [{"number":"1","parValue":"4","yards":"381","body":"This is a short dogleg right requiring an accurate tee shot to avoid the water hazard that lines the right side and creek that runs across the end of the fairway. Players will hit a short iron or wedge into a green that is protected by deep bunkers on the left. Pin placements on the rear of the green tend to be very quick with severe breaks, while front pin placements are very accessible and likely will be rewarded with a flat putt for birdie.","image":""},{"number":"2","parValue":"3","yards":"190","body":"Facing directly towards the Statue of Liberty, this hole plays differently from day to day and often changes throughout the round due to shifting winds. Liberty's second longest par three, expect players to hit a mid to long iron into a green that is well-protected by a large bunker on the left side and a single bunker that frames the right side.","image":""},{"number":"3","parValue":"4","yards":"397","body":"Accuracy off the tee is required. The left side of the fairway slopes severely left, leaving the player with a blind second shot over two large mounds into the most severe green on the course. Players must also avoid the bunkers which protect the right side of the fairway. Shots that miss the green to the right, left or short will roll away from the green severely, requiring tremendous skill in salvaging par.","image":""},{"number":"4","parValue":"3","yards":"178","body":"The Manhattan skyline provides a dramatic backdrop for the fourth hole. The figure eight shaped green, which slopes from back to front, has two distinct areas for hole locations. Club selection is key as any shot that misses the green in either hole location requires a difficult up-and-down to save par.","image":""},{"number":"5","parValue":"4","yards":"424","body":"The fifth hole at Liberty National is one of the most demanding. It requires two precise golf shots; anything less leaves you vulnerable to bogey or worse. The downhill tee shot doesn't require driver, but a shot in the fairway is the key to success. Water framing the entire left side of the hole makes even a short approach shot seem daunting.","image":""},{"number":"6","parValue":"5","yards":"528","body":"This par 5 gives you plenty of driving room with the exception of a fairway bunker on the right. Depending on wind conditions and quality of tee shot, the green can be reached in two. Water starts 300 yards out and extends all the way to the green, requiring attention to be paid even to a layup shot. This large, receptive green gives many interesting hole locations.","image":""},{"number":"7","parValue":"4","yards":"470","body":"This challenging par 4 begins on the tee box; the landing area is framed by bunkers on both left and ride sides of the fairway. This large green is very shallow and extends left to right. An approach shot is best played from the left side of the fairway. Par is a very good score.","image":""},{"number":"8","parValue":"5","yards":"615","body":"This is the longest hole on the golf course and it begins with a demanding drive from an elevated tee. For most players, this is a three shot hole. It is critical to position yourself with the best possible angle for your approach shot. A well-bunkered green that shapes left to right makes for a number of different shots required to have a good opportunity for birdie.","image":""},{"number":"9","parValue":"4","yards":"464","body":"This hole provides another elevated tee shot that requires the player to stay short of the creek that runs across the fairway. Depending on wind conditions, a driver may not be needed. The second shot is uphill and the player's inability to see the putting surface adds an element of uncertainty","image":""},{"number":"10","parValue":"4","yards":"489","body":"The longest par 4 on the course points the players back to the clubhouse and the New York skyline. A slight dogleg right, a lateral water hazard runs the entire length of the hole on the right side. A large bunker on the left comes into play with an errant tee shot. Most players will play a mid-iron into the deepest green on the course. Three bunkers, one on the left and two on the right, frame the green, which has multiple levels and many possible hole locations.","image":""},{"number":"11","parValue":"3","yards":"214","body":"The longest par 3 on the course, but the yardage is a little deceptive because of the downhill tee shot. The sensible play is to go for the front right of the green, taking out the water that surrounds the entire left side and the very difficult collection area to the right.","image":""},{"number":"12","parValue":"4","yards":"432","body":"Another dramatic elevated tee shot gives the players the option to hit to the left or right of the bunkers that split the fairway. The left fairway provides the best angle to all hole locations. The green is surrounded by bunkers and collection areas both back and left, which should be avoided at all costs.","image":""},{"number":"13","parValue":"5","yards":"548","body":"This reachable par 5 forces players to think carefully when planning their second shot. After a relatively easy tee shot, players are faced with a decision to either aggressively go for the green, which requires carrying the lake that fronts it, or lay up to the right and try to make birdie with a wedge. The Statue of Liberty is never out of sight and this hole offers one of the best views of this great monument.","image":""},{"number":"14","parValue":"3","yards":"149","body":"The shortest hole on the golf course is Liberty National's signature hole. Located on New York Bay, it offers unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, The Manhattan skyline and the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge. All shots will be with a wedge or short iron into a green that is well-protected by bunkers, fescue and a lateral hazard surrounding the green. Players will face swirling winds that make club selection critical.","image":""},{"number":"15","parValue":"4","yards":"469","body":"A very strong and demanding hole which requires both length and accuracy off the tee. Two deep bunkers protect the left side of the fairway and three bunkers are located on the right. The green is set into a natural amphitheater with one huge wrap-around bunker on the left. The putting surface is divided by one large undulation in the center of the green, which makes it extremely quick from back to front.","image":""},{"number":"16","parValue":"4","yards":"311","body":"This is a short, drivable par 4. A waste bunker and water hazard run up the entire right side of the hole and come into play, especially since the wind often blows from the left. The green slopes towards the water hazard, making any shot played from the left side of the green extremely difficult, including from the lone greenside bunker on the left.","image":""},{"number":"17","parValue":"4","yards":"429","body":"A strong, straightforward par 4 that plays back towards the Bay, often into the wind. A series of bunkers line the left side of the fairway, with two bunkers and fescue on the right. Two large bunkers protect all center and right pin placements on this two-tiered green. The putting surface is also protected by slopes on the left side and heavy rough to the rear of the green. Expect to see a wide variety of shots played should anyone miss this green in two.","image":""},{"number":"18","parValue":"4","yards":"489","body":"The entire hole sits on the Bay with unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty. Players will face a demanding tee shot to a fairway which is lined by deep bunkers on each side and hit into a variety of wind conditions, especially in the afternoon. The green slopes from back to front and is protected by three bunkers, making club selection critical on the second shot. Look for this green to be extremely quick, especially when the wind kicks up.","image":""}]}]}
