{"header": { "version" : "1.0"},"pageType":"course","tourCode":"r","permNum":"019","pageTitle":"Course","courses": [{"number":"243","sortOrder":"1","name":"Trinity Forest Golf Club","parValue":"71","yards":"7,380","body":"","image":"","holes": [{"number":"1","parValue":"5","yards":"552","body":"A driver well struck can sneak between the right fairway bunkers and the rough on the left leaving the player with a mid to long iron to the green. Players who lay up short of the bunkers will have an option to go for the green with long irons and fairway metals, but the green's severe undulation on the front right will make hitting the green much more challenging.","image":""},{"number":"2","parValue":"3","yards":"235","body":"This long par 3 will require a mid-to-long iron to the green that is 50 yards. Misses to the left will be challenged by a large roll along the left side of the green. A tee shot to the right will end up 3-4 feet below the green on a tightly mown surround making par saves difficult. ","image":""},{"number":"3","parValue":"4","yards":"412","body":"This hole is a short beauty of a par 4 that asks players to either lay up short of a large cross bunker or play to the left of the bunker with a driver or fairway metal. The decision on the tee is influenced by the hole location as the second shot difficulty is impacted by the angle to the hole relative to the wind. ","image":""},{"number":"4","parValue":"4","yards":"443","body":"This par 4's long dog-leg right will require one of the most demanding tee shots. Successful, long hitters who challenge the large mound down the right side will set up a short iron or wedge into this narrow green. A drive too far left will find the left fairway bunker or the native grasses leaving a difficult approach from a poor angle to the pin.","image":""},{"number":"5","parValue":"4","yards":"315","body":"This uphill, usually down-wind, \"Evil Twin\" (shaped by Bill Coore with a similar green as hole 15) presents the most options off the tee of any hole on the course. With the green only 315 yards away, players will be able to drive the hole with drivers and fairway metals. Players will need to carry the large bunker that sits 40 yards short of the green, otherwise the ball could bound over the green. Both hole 15 and 5 greens are small, slope back to front, and are severely perched. ","image":""},{"number":"6","parValue":"4","yards":"420","body":"Hole location is key for this tee show. Choosing the left side of the bunkers that sit on the center of the fairway will require golfers to thread the needle between the two bunkers down the left and the middle traps. The fairway on the right side of the bunkers is generous but could leave a more challenging second depending on hole location. ","image":""},{"number":"7","parValue":"5","yards":"570","body":"A drive down the left side of the course's second par 5 will challenge a hazard but be rewarded with a superior angle for second shot. The safer drive down the middle, right side of this wide fairway will need to play back to the green as the hazard awaits shots that do not hold on the green, but reveals a difficult spine that runs down the right side of the green. ","image":""},{"number":"8","parValue":"3","yards":"140","body":"The shortest hole on the course requires a precise short-iron or wedge into this small green that is divided by a hogs-back that creates a small target to the left and a small trough on the right. Players that miss this green will need to play chip shots away from the hole so slopes can help to save par. ","image":""},{"number":"9","parValue":"4","yards":"505","body":"This long par 4 requires the player to take on the hazard down the left side to setup a superior angle to the green. There is a small bunker sitting 165 yards from the green in the middle of the fairway with 25 yards between the hazard and bunker. The green is severely sloped from right to left and is well guarded in front by a large roll. Tee shots played down the right side of the fairway will be left hitting approach shots over a deep bunker that sits 20 years short of the green. Approach shots should be played to the right side of green. ","image":""},{"number":"10","parValue":"4","yards":"416","body":"A medium length par 4 that typically plays back into prevailing south winds. The right side of the hole is defined by buffalo grass and bunkers. A well-aimed tee shot will land in front of the left bunker, sitting 280 yards away and approach the green with a short iron to navigate the front roll and left valley. ","image":""},{"number":"11","parValue":"4","yards":"471","body":"The green on this long par 4 is the largest, contoured green on the course that can leave players with very long, challenging putts after misplayed approaches. Be careful to avoid the large mound sitting on the front middle of the green. Players can use the large slopes to the right, left, and back on the green as backstops to help in difficult hole locations. ","image":""},{"number":"12","parValue":"3","yards":"205","body":"This long par 3 typically plays downwind into a deep green with large mounds on the right side and a hazard and bunkers catching errant shots hit to the left. Players should use the mounds on the right to send balls down to hole locations on the left. However, players that miss the green to the right will risk losing multiple shots to par. ","image":""},{"number":"13","parValue":"4","yards":"480","body":"Beware long drives down the right side as the fairway ends after 300 yards. Balls challenging the bunker and hazard on the left will be rewarded with 50 more yards of fairway and a superior approach angle. An up and down off the right of the green will prove difficult due to the spine down the right side. Sand traps on the green's left side are safer miss. ","image":""},{"number":"14","parValue":"5","yards":"630","body":"The longest hole on the course calls for decisions to navigate the very large bunker that divides the fairway. If the golfer carries the bunker they will be left with a blind fairway metal or long iron to a hidden downhill green. There are also bunkers short and right of the green. Tee shots down the narrow right side will be left with a shorter distance to the hotel. Tee shots down on the left will be left with a layup shot aimed right. The green runs left to right with two large mounds on the left side. ","image":""},{"number":"15","parValue":"4","yards":"440","body":"This demanding uphill par-4 will require the players to challenge bunkers down the left side of the fairway to setup the best angle of attack into this second of the Evil Twin greens. The green is sloped back to front leaving the back of the green severely perched in the air. The front of the green is guarded on the right by a mound. ","image":""},{"number":"16","parValue":"4","yards":"429","body":"This short par-4 leaves a strategic decision off the tee. The fairway gets pinched by a series of bunkers as the player gets closer to the well-guarded green, but a safe play with a fairway metal or long-iron will leave a short-iron or wedge into the green. The riskier tee shot with a driver must navigate the bunkers but could set up an easy birdie. ","image":""},{"number":"17","parValue":"3","yards":"215","body":"The final par-3 on the course requires careful analysis given the green divided by a significant roll in the middle. Hole location will determine which strategy is best given the two troughs on the green. Shots that land short in the front or long in the back should be played left away from the pin for green contours to roll the ball to the pin. ","image":""},{"number":"18","parValue":"4","yards":"502","body":"The final hole plays as a very long par-4. The best approach will come from the right side of the fairway, guarded by a hazard and bunkers. The green slopes front left to back right and includes a large mound on the left and steep runoff on the right. Smart chips will use the green slope to send the ball close to the hole.
